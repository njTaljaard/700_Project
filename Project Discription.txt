Prioritized Foraging using Robot Swarms

Recently, we have developed prioritized foraging models to control robots swarms to collect items,
where different items have different priorities. The two model are based on the foraging behvior of
bees and that of the desert ant. For both mdels, each agent (robot) follow very simple rules to find,
collect, and return an object to a store. This study will adapt this model in two ways:

1. The objects will first be clustered using a clustering algorithm modeled after the cemetery organization
behavior of ants. When the clustering is done, then the foraging algorithms mentioned
above will be executed.

2. Agents decide whether they want to be a clustering or a forager using a division of labor model
(seen in ant colonie). Initially more agents should cluster, but over time more should move to
foraging.
