Provide an introduction, stating that this chapter summarises the conclusions of your work, and consider future directions that related research could take. Again, reference Sections~\ref{sec:conclusions:conclusion_summary} and \ref{sec:conclusions:future_work}.

\section{Summary of Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions:conclusion_summary}

Summarise your conclusions here. You should consider each of the objectives you listed in the introduction, and explain how each was met, providing a discussion on what your specific findings were for each. Also mention what novel contributions (these might include a new taxonomy, model, algorithm, or empirical results not previously published) your work has introduced to the field while the various objectives were being addressed.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions:future_work}

Enumerate the future work that you could foresee developing from the work you have done here. Mention areas you could not focus on, or possible extensions to your work. It is a good idea to be thorough, since you increase your chances of being referenced by other researchers who follow up on your work, even if you do not do so yourself. You may consider writing this as a bulleted list, if you mention many aspects.
