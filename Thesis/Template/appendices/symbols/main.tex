\chapter{Symbols}
\label{app:symbols}

Provide a brief introduction, in which you explain that all the symbols used throughout the dissertation are defined in this appendix, under the chapter in which they first appear. Also mention that re-definitions of symbols are introduced in the chapters in which they occur (but try very hard to avoid this). Do not repeat symbol definitions in later chapters. Try to keep definitions as short as possible (try not to wrap onto the next line). You may play with the length called \texttt{namewidth} (defined in \texttt{dissertation.tex}) to make sure that all the symbols fit properly throughout this list. Provide the chapter name in each section, as appropriate. Leave out chapters with no symbol definitions. Also note that you may provide a reference to an equation defining a symbol if you choose to (although this limits the space you have to work with) --- decide if you want to do this, or not, and stick to either one or the other:
